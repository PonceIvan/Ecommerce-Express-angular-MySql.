MRtracker is a web application and android application developed by me
It is like ecommerce application about Pharmacy. in this app there are two types of user one is normal user who can buy online product 
and another is MR(Medical representative) who will deal with doctors about their products and products will be delivered to doctors according to dealing date. MR will be salary based. and location of each MR also be tracked by Admin.
I developed Admin panel Also, in this panel I am maintaing the users, MRs account, order of each MRs, product, location of MRs etc.

I used technologies Angular with typescript,bootstarp,NodeJS,express web server,mysql database
